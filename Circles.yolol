:x=(:x+10)%360 :vOff=:rd*(sin(:x)) :hOff=:rd*cos :x goto:mode
:x=(:x+10)%360 :vOff=0 :hOff=:rd*(sin :x) goto:mode
:x=(:x+10)%360 :vOff=:rd*(sin :x) :hOff=0 goto:mode

and on my laser chip I'm not actually doing atan (3.9)/:d, I'm doing atan(3.9+:hOff)/:d to aim at a distance offset by :hOff, which oscillates between -1 and 1 due to that chip above doing the sine/cosine of x stuff (this part does actually mean that all lasers must calculate pitch and rotation, can't just get by with either or if they're mounted conveniently on an axis, so I guess you don't really save anything doing that in the end.)
so in total each laser has its own professional chip doing 
:pitch=atan((Laser_horizontal_coords+:hOff)/:d) :rot=atan((laser_vertical_coords+:voff)/:d) goto1
 plus the chip that controls the oscillation
@[Empire]NikofrankoV|ðŸŽ„ is now!
or, well, some of those lasers actually subtract the offset instead of adding it
to make them all trace the same circle instead of each doing their own
the second and third lines of the magic chip just set the horizontal or vertical offsets to 0 instead of letting them oscillate between -1 and 1, to toggle between them I have a lever with an output range from 1 to 3, center output of 2, and a deadzone of like 1.95, so the only valid positions are perfectly centered, all the way left, or all the way right
and just goto that lever state (:mode)to select which movement mode I want
:rd is the radius of the circle; it just multiplies the horizontal or vertical offset values by the leverstate of yet another lever
